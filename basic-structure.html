<h1> My name is Sydney McKenna </h1>
  <p> I'm a curret senior that goes to Davidson College.  I play field hockey on their Division 1 program,
    and am the biggest lover of dogs anyone could ask for.  <br> I have two dogs at home (Lola and Rose) who I love dearly.</p>
  <p> I also have two sisters, one who lives in Maui, Hawaii and another who lives in Charlotte, North Carolina.
    I have one niece and one nephew who I love so much, and I am originally from Wisconsin. </p>

<h2> Things I Like Doing </h2>
  <p> One of my favorite things to do is to take pictures around campus and back at home.  I would consider myself a
    pretty good photographer, however field hockey has taken up so much of my time I haven't been able to photograph as
    much as I had wanted to. </p>
  <p> I love traveling, whether that is within a city or around to different countries.  If Corona hadn't happened this year,
    my sister and I were going to go travel in eastern Asia and the Australian coast.  I feel I have been to so many places
    that it is so hard to keep track of where I have been! </p>
